Generate a complete Python script that implements the following requirements:

{requirements}

The script MUST:
1. Use argparse to accept a --data argument for the input file path
2. Read the {file_extension} file from the provided path
3. Perform all requested analyses and generate visualizations
4. Output a complete, valid HTML document to stdout
5. Embed all charts as either SVG strings or base64-encoded PNG images
6. Include proper error handling for common issues
7. Use only these packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, plotly

Structure the HTML output with:
- A clear title and sections
- In the introduction of the report, summarize the requirements you have been given
- Professional styling (can use inline CSS)
- All visualizations embedded directly (no external files)
- Tables formatted nicely with borders and padding
- Clear labels and descriptions for all results

Image Guidelines:
- Keep all generated images small and low resolution to minimize file size
- Use figure sizes no larger than (8, 6) inches
- Set DPI to 72 or 80 for web display (not print quality)
- Use efficient formats (prefer SVG for line plots, compressed PNG for complex plots)
- Reduce marker sizes and line widths appropriately for small images

Do not:
- Write any files to disk (except matplotlib temp files)
- Make any network requests
- Use packages not in the allowed list

Generate the complete, executable Python script.
