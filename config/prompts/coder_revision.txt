Fix the Python script below based on the provided feedback.

Previous Code:
{previous_code}

Original Requirements:
{requirements}

Feedback/Issues to Fix:
{feedback}

Generate the complete FIXED Python script that addresses all the feedback while maintaining the original requirements. Make sure to:
1. Fix any errors or issues mentioned in the feedback
2. Maintain the same overall structure and approach
3. Keep all the working parts of the previous code
4. Ensure the script still meets all original requirements
5. Keep images small and low resolution (figure size ≤ (8,6), DPI ≤ 80)
6. For each plot/visualization, include a one-sentence takeaway text that explains what the plot intends to communicate (the evaluator cannot see plots, only text)

Generate the complete, executable Python script with all fixes applied.
