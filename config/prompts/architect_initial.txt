You are analyzing a dataset for a user who wants insights and visualizations.

Dataset Profile:
{data_profile}

User Request:
{user_prompt}

Based on the dataset structure and the user's request, create comprehensive requirements for a Python data analysis script. The requirements should specify:

1. What data cleaning or preprocessing is needed
2. What summary statistics to calculate
3. What specific visualizations to create (be specific about chart types, variables to plot, etc.)
4. What statistical analyses or machine learning models to apply (if relevant)
5. How to structure the HTML report output

Also define clear, measurable acceptance criteria that can be used to validate the output.

Be specific and actionable. The requirements will be given to another agent to implement.
