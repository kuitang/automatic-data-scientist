  "grade": "B",
  "grade_justification": "Most core requirements are met: comprehensive performance comparison across periods, explicit best/worst identification, stated transaction costs with net-of-costs results, and multiple data-driven insights. However, a key risk requirement is incomplete: the full-sample max drawdown and annualized Sharpe are missing for the MA Trend strategy. The per-period consolidated table is also truncated/malformed, which undermines clarity and auditability, even though the necessary numbers are present in the narrative. These issues prevent an A-range grade, but the analysis is otherwise solid, warranting a B.",
  "criteria_evaluation": "- Criterion 1 (Final value and total return for each strategy across full, early, middle, late, net of costs): Partially met via text. Full-sample values and returns are clearly reported in the Full-Sample table. Early, middle, and late values and returns are provided in the Data-Driven Insights list for all three strategies. However, the consolidated \u201cPer-Period Performance\u201d table is truncated/malformed (\u2026 [truncated] \u2026, misaligned cells, and \u201cpp\u201d entries), so the tabular audit trail is incomplete. Still, all required numbers appear in the narrative.\n- Criterion 2 (Explicit best/worst by final value for each period and overall): Met. Full-sample best/worst are explicitly stated. Early, middle, and late thirds each identify best and worst strategies, with the magnitude of differences.\n- Criterion 3 (Full-sample max drawdown and annualized Sharpe, RF=0%, for each strategy): Not met. Only partial risk metrics are reported in the insights: Sharpe and drawdown are given for Buy & Hold and Time-Series Momentum, but max drawdown and Sharpe for the MA Trend strategy are missing. There is no dedicated risk table covering all three strategies.\n- Criterion 4 (State per-transaction cost and confirm results are net): Met. Assumption of 0.05% per position change is stated, and it is explicitly noted that results are net of these costs.\n- Criterion 5 (At least two concise, data-driven insights referencing reported metrics): Met. Multiple insights are provided, referencing specific final values, returns, Sharpe, and drawdowns across periods.\n- Data handling validity (chronological order, Adj Close basis, missing/duplicates): Met as stated. Dates parsed/sorted, signals executed next day, Adjusted Close used for signals and equity curves, and handling of duplicates/missing documented (both zero).",
  "is_complete": true,
  "feedback": "- Add full-sample risk metrics for the MA Trend strategy: explicitly report its max drawdown (%) and annualized Sharpe ratio (with risk-free rate = 0%). Ideally present a small \u201cFull-Sample Risk Metrics\u201d table with all three strategies side by side.\n- Fix the \u201cPer-Period Performance\u201d table so it is complete and audit-ready: include one row for each of the 12 (Period \u00d7 Strategy) combinations with Final Value ($) and Total Return (%). Remove or relocate the \u201cpp\u201d (percentage points) comparison figures to a separate summary section to avoid column misalignment.\n- Optionally, explicitly state that each segment\u2019s performance assumes a fresh $1,000 initial capital for that segment to remove any ambiguity.\n- Consider noting the risk-free assumption (0%) alongside the Sharpe figures to make the methodology unambiguous in the risk section."
