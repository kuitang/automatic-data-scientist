  "grade": "A-",
  "grade_justification": "All acceptance criteria are satisfied with clear, specific numbers. The report delivers the required strategy comparisons across the full sample and distinct regimes, includes max drawdowns, applies transaction costs, and performs a significance test with a p-value and conclusion. Minor issues include slightly confusing phrasing around whether transaction costs change the ranking and generic conclusions that don\u2019t fully reflect the presented period results. These are small clarity issues rather than missing requirements, hence an A-.",
  "criteria_evaluation": "Criterion 1 (Highest importance) \u2013 Met. Four distinct strategies (Buy & Hold, SMA 20/100, 60d TS Momentum, RSI MR) with full-sample final portfolio values in dollars are reported, and the top performer (SMA 20/100) is explicitly named.\n\nCriterion 2 (High importance) \u2013 Met. Three non-overlapping regimes are identified with start/end dates (uptrend, selloff, sideways). For each, final values for all strategies are listed and the top performer for that period is named.\n\nCriterion 3 (High importance) \u2013 Met. Full-sample max drawdown percentages are given for each strategy, and the smallest (TS Momentum) and largest (RSI MR) are identified.\n\nCriterion 4 (Medium importance) \u2013 Mostly met. Transaction costs (10 bps per trade) are applied and new full-sample final values are provided. It states the ranking changes and also that the top strategy is unchanged (SMA 20/100). While correct (B&H overtakes TS Momentum), the wording is slightly confusing; explicitly listing the new ranking would remove ambiguity.\n\nCriterion 5 (Medium importance) \u2013 Met. A p-value (0.3567) for the difference in mean daily returns between the top active strategy (SMA 20/100) and Buy & Hold is provided with a clear 5% significance conclusion (not significant).",
  "is_complete": true,
  "feedback": "- Transaction-cost ranking clarity: You note \u201cDoes the ranking change? Yes\u201d and \u201cTop strategy unchanged.\u201d To avoid ambiguity, explicitly list the post-cost ranking (e.g., SMA > Buy & Hold > TS Momentum > RSI) and briefly state which positions changed.\n- Align narrative to results: Your plain-language conclusions say trend-following excels in uptrends and mean reversion can add value in sideways markets, but in your numbers Buy & Hold outperforms trend-following in the uptrend, and RSI is flat in the sideways window. Revise the narrative to reflect your actual findings (e.g., \u201cIn the selected uptrend, Buy & Hold beat active trend filters; in the sideways window, none of the active rules clearly outperformed Buy & Hold.\u201d).\n- Methods and data validity: Briefly confirm you used split/dividend-adjusted prices (Adj Close), that signals are generated with only information available at the time (no lookahead), and specify execution timing and assumptions (e.g., next-day open/close, no cash yield). This strengthens credibility against the original data-validity requirements.\n- Statistical test details: Note whether the p-value is two-sided and the exact test used (e.g., Welch\u2019s t-test on daily return differences), and confirm any assumptions (iid, variance treatment). This adds transparency.\n- Trading frictions: Clarify whether 10 bps is per side or per round trip and, optionally, report approximate trade counts per strategy to contextualize the cost impact."
