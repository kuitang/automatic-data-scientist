  "grade_justification": "All acceptance criteria are satisfied with explicit values and correct framing. The report also includes data readiness checks, group-wise summaries, strongest 2D separation, and cluster-driving features. Minor clarity issues remain (e.g., not explicitly stating the visual separability in PCA space and a contradictory note about negative silhouette implying overlap), but these do not affect the required criteria. Overall, strong and complete against the specified acceptance criteria.",
  "criteria_evaluation": "- Pearson correlation (strongest pair): Met. Clearly states petal.length vs petal.width with Pearson r = 0.963.\n- Most discriminative individual feature with ANOVA p-value: Met. Identifies petal.length as most discriminative with one-way ANOVA p = 2.857e-91.\n- Optimal k via silhouette and its score: Met. Reports k = 2 selected by average silhouette with score = 0.582.\n- ARI vs. true labels: Met. Reports Adjusted Rand Index = 0.568 for KMeans(k=2) vs. species.\n- Variance explained by first two PCs: Met. Reports cumulative variance explained by PC1+PC2 = 95.81%.",
  "is_complete": true,
  "feedback": "- PCA separability: Explicitly state what the PC1\u2013PC2 plot shows (e.g., Setosa clearly separated; Versicolor and Virginica show partial overlap along PC2) rather than saying it \u201cshows whether.\u201d\n- Silhouette interpretation: The statement that 0 items with negative silhouette \u201csuggest areas of cluster overlap\u201d is contradictory. Zero negatives indicate good separation; if overlap exists, point to low (near-zero) silhouettes or specific clusters/regions.\n- Clustering justification: Consider reporting silhouette scores for neighboring k (e.g., k=3) and briefly explain why k=2 was preferred despite species being three classes. A short numeric contingency table (clusters vs. species) would also strengthen the alignment summary.\n- Discriminative feature context: Optionally add an effect size (e.g., eta-squared) and indicate which species means differ most for petal.length to provide practical context alongside the ANOVA p-value.\n- Best 2D separation: Briefly justify the choice of sepal.length + petal.width as best 2D pair (e.g., compared against other pairs) and, if possible, report the runner-up pair to show robustness."
